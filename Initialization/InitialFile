For creating an remote production environment you should create azure services. Here is the list of services:
* App service (for ASP.NET Core application)
* SQL server and SQl Database in it
* Application insights
* Azure storage account

And you will need sms-service! Right now application use smsgorod.ru

After creating them you will need to create configurations in your app service:
* APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY (there will be a GUID inside with your application insights instrumation key)
* AZURE_ENABLESMSSERVICE (bool flag to enable or disable SMS service)
* AZURESTORAGE_CONNECTIONSTRING (connection string to your Azure storage account)
* FIREBASE_KEY (create your application account on google firebase services and copy this key here)
* SMSSENDING_APIKEY (ApiKey for sms)
* WEBSITE_HTTPLOGGING_RETENTION_DAYS (number of days, I use 10)
* WEBSITE_WEBDEPLOY_USE_SCM (false by default)

And add connection string to your database:
* AZURESQLCONNSTR_CONNECTIONSTRING

After everything don't forget to add IP of your app service to sql server firewall whitelist!
